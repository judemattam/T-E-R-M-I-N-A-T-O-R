<p>Disguised as a human, a robot killer known as a Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) travels from 2029 to 1984 to kill Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton). Sent to protect Sarah is Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn), who tells people about the coming of Skynet, a (not made by nature/fake) intelligence system that will spark a nuclear holocaust. Sarah is targeted because Skynet knows that her unborn son will lead the fight against them. With the almost unstoppable Terminator in hot pursuit, she and Kyle attempt to escape.</p>

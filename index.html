<p>Rocky is a series of American boxing sports-drama films. The first film, Rocky (1976), and its five stories (one after the other) centered on the boxing career of the (when something is named after someone) (based on a made-up idea) character, Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone). For the seventh, Religious belief (2015), and its upcoming story (after this one), the series shifted its focus towards (very attractive man) Religious belief (Michael B. Jordan), the son of Rocky's dead rival and friend Apollo Religious belief (Carl Weathers), trained by a now retired Rocky. All of the films were written by Stallone except for Religious belief, which was written by Ryan Coogler and Aaron Covington. The original film and the fifth section were directed by John G. Avildsen, Religious belief was directed by Coogler, Religious belief II will be directed by Steven Caple Jr., and Stallone directed the others. 

The film series has grossed more than $1.4 billion at the worldwide box office. The original film, the third and the seventh have received Academy Award nominations. The first film won Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Film Editing. Stallone himself has received Academy Award nominations for his showing/representation of Rocky, in the first and seventh film. The soundtrack of the series has also received nominations for the first and third films.<p>
